 - Need to know how to set up views
    - Use ui-view to replace with templates
    - DO NOT use ng-controller
    - Map state to
        - url
        - controller
        - templateUrl
    - Make sure that the controllers are written using the app.controller syntax and not directly provided in the
      state provider syntax (for reasons of testability)
 - Work with services for Test backend
